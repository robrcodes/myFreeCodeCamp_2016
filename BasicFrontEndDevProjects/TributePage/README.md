#Build a Tribute Page

This is (currently) the first project build for Free Code Camp. The instructions for this task require you to build a very simple tribute page on CodePen.io with the following user stories:

* I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
* I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.

My solution to this project can be seen at [CodePen.io](http://codepen.io/robrenwick/full/obavKO/).
